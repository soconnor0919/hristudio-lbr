   abstract = {Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) is a common technique enabling HRI researchers to explore aspects of interaction not yet backed by autonomous systems. A standardized, open, and flexible WoZ framework could therefore serve the community and accelerate research both for the design of robotic systems and for their evaluation. This paper presents the definition of Open-WoZ, a Wizard-of-Oz framework for HRI, designed to be updated during operation by the researcher controlling the robot. OpenWoZ is implemented as a thin HTTP server running on the robot, and a cloud-backed multi-platform client schema. The WoZ server accepts representational state transfer (REST) requests from a number and variety of clients simultaneously. This "separation of concerns" in OpenWoZ allows addition of commands , new sequencing of behaviors, and adjustment of parameters, all during run-time.},

abstract = {Many researchers use Wizard of Oz (WoZ) as an experimental technique, but there are methodological concerns over its use, and no comprehensive criteria on how to best employ it. We systematically review 54 WoZ experiments published in the primary HRI publication venues from 2001 -- 2011. Using criteria proposed by Fraser and Gilbert (1991), Green et al. (2004), Steinfeld et al. (2009), and Kelley (1984), we analyzed how researchers conducted HRI WoZ experiments. Researchers mainly used WoZ for verbal (72.2\%) and non-verbal (48.1\%) processing. Most constrained wizard production (90.7\%), but few constrained wizard recognition (11\%). Few reported measuring wizard error (3.7\%), and few reported pre-experiment wizard training (5.4\%). Few reported using WoZ in an iterative manner (24.1\%). Based on these results we propose new reporting guidelines to aid future research.},

abstract={Wizard-of-Oz experiments play a vital role in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), as they allow for quick and simple hypothesis testing. Still, a publicly available general tool to conduct such experiments is currently not available in the research community, and researchers often develop and implement their own tools, customized for each individual experiment. Besides being inefficient in terms of programming efforts, this also makes it harder for non-technical researchers to conduct Wizard-of-Oz experiments. In this paper, we present a general and easy-to-use tool for the Pepper robot, one of the most commonly used robots in this context. While we provide the concrete interface for Pepper robots only, the system architecture is independent of the type of robot and can be adapted for other robots. A configuration file, which saves experiment-specific parameters, enables a quick setup for reproducible and repeatable Wizard-of-Oz experiments. A central server provides a graphical interface via a browser while handling the mapping of user input to actions on the robot. In our interface, keyboard shortcuts may be assigned to phrases, gestures, and composite behaviors to simplify and speed up control of the robot. The interface is lightweight and independent of the operating system. Our initial tests confirm that the system is functional, flexible, and easy to use. The interface, including source code, is made commonly available, and we hope that it will be useful for researchers with any background who want to conduct HRI experiments.}
